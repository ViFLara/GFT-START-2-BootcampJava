# Digital Innovation One:  
# GFT-START-2-JavaBootcamp - Learning Object Orientation

 Java project that explores the pillars of Object Orientation (OO) in practice.

* Abstraction

  Ability to focus on the essentials of a domain, ignoring less important or accidental features. In this context, objects are abstractions of entities existing in   the domain in question.

* Encapsulation

  Encapsulating means hiding the implementation of objects. Encapsulation mainly favors two aspects of a system: maintenance and evolution.

* Heritage

  Allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called     the base class. The class that inherits the members of the base class is called a derived class.
 
* Polymorphism

  Ability of an object to be referenced in various ways. Be careful, polymorphism does not mean that  the object keeps changing, quite the contrary, an object is     born of a type and dies of that type, what can change is the way we refer to it. The ability to treat objects created from specific classes as objects of a         generic class is called polymorphism.
